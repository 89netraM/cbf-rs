# CBF-rs

Reading CBF/imgCIF images.

## Goals

The immediate goal is to read the specific images produced by the PILATUS 1.2
machine at Petra III.

The ultimate goal is to support all different encodings, compression algorithms,
and element types.

Notice that it is not the goal of this project to read CIF data. More precisely,
the only goal of this project is read the image data.
